# DrawReview
simple draw applications for review Android development.

Draw2 is a paint application for android system, built with android studio, based on a tutorial : https://medium.com/@ssaurel/learn-to-create-a-paint-application-for-android-5b16968063f8   Author: ssaurel

The goal for this project is review the android development, type those code one by one ,instead copy paste them. trying to get familiar with android studio(like those suggestion drop down after a variable), because I haven't touch Android studio for a while.

However, This tutorial is not complete or I missed some important part, the "Menu Part" of this tutorial was not implemented in a right way.
So I made several stupid ways to achrive the "Menu Part", like adding buttons in the interface, like change Pan color, increseing, and decresing PanWidth, Emboss and Blur modes. 
As result, the interface looks so ugly, on other side, without tutorial, I keep recalling the memory about android develop like adding views by Id, some layout example/difference between each type, and click listener function...etc

I was trying to add a floating Menu button, but I didn't find the component in the android studio default library, I have searched few solutions they all likely to use outside(thirdParty) library or API, which is not my goal of this project.

The project is not super impressive, but I am still happy with it,after this is project, I am trying to build a simple calculator without tutorial to keep refresh my memory about android development.

Non-stop coding, Non-stop loving.

Second Project is Calculator, the calculater is really simply just calculate two number in {  + - * / }
Keep refresh my memory about Android studio, from this project, I remembered use Log.d to debug the program, which is really helpful.
The first version of project just finished in few hours, and later on will expand more functions I will.
