# DrawReview
simple draw applications for review Android develop

Draw2 is a paint application for android system, built with android studio, based on a tutorial : https://medium.com/@ssaurel/learn-to-create-a-paint-application-for-android-5b16968063f8   Author: ssaurel

The goal for this project is review the android development, type those code one by one ,instead copy paste them. trying to get familiar with android studio(like those suggestion drop down after a variable), because I haven't touch Android studio for a while.

However, This tutorial is not complete or I missed some important part, the "Menu Part" of this tutorial was not implemented in a right way.
So I made several stupid ways to achrive the "Menu Part", like adding buttons in the interface, like change Pan color, increseing, and decresing PanWidth, Emboss and Blur modes. 
As result, the interface looks so ugly, on other side, without tutorial, I keep recalling the memmory about android develop like adding views by Id, some layout example/difference btween each type, and click listener function...etc

I was trying to a floating Menu button, but I didn't find the component in the android studio default library, I have searched few solutions they all likely to use outside(thirdParty) library or API, which is not my goal of this project.

The project is not super impressive, but I am still happy with it.

Non-stop coding, Non-stop loving.
